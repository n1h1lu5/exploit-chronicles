# Deserialization .NET Newtonsoft Auto TypeNameHandling

The blog post that uses this code can be found here: [https://n1h1lu5.com/2024/06/exploit-chronicles-json-net-auto-typenamehandling-deserialization-exploit/](https://n1h1lu5.com/2024/06/exploit-chronicles-json-net-auto-typenamehandling-deserialization-exploit/).

## Running the Application

It is a standard .NET Framework 4.8 Web API. Therefore, .NET Framework 4.8 is required. Then, open the solution in Visual Studio, build it, run it.

## Accessing the Application on your Local Network

By default, IIS Express (what is running the web application locally) will only work on your localhost. If you want to be able to access the web application accross your local network (in case you want to interact with it through a VM), you can use the following trick. On the Windows host running the web application, run:

- `npm install -g iisexpress-proxy`
- `iisexpress-proxy <port-on-localhost> to <port-to-expose>`

The web application will now be accessible at: `http://<your-local-network-ip>:<port-to-expose>`
