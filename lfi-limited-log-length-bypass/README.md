# LFI with Limited Log Length Bypass

The blog post that uses this code can be found here: [https://n1h1lu5.com/2024/05/exploit-chronicles-local-file-inclusion-through-logs-with-a-catch/](https://n1h1lu5.com/2024/05/exploit-chronicles-local-file-inclusion-through-logs-with-a-catch/).

## Running the Application

Anything that can run PHP will do, but these are the steps for Kali.

- Move the `index.php` file and the entire folder `pages` to `/var/www/html`
- Create the folder `/var/www/logs`
- Create the file `/var/www/logs/log.txt`
- Give read and write access to log.txt (`chown` or `chmod`) to the Apache service
- Start the Apache service `sudo service apache2 start`
- You can now access the web application at `http://127.0.0.1/index.php`
